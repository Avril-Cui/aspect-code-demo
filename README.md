# Introduction

The Aspect trading game is scenario- and event-driven, offering users a platform to explore and solidify finance knowledge, develop niche-specific trading strategies that suit them, and help them optimally capitalize on market opportunities while managing risks.

# Directories
## Backend
### Function
Contains all the helper functions used in the backend; primarily functions to assist data communication with the database and the frontend.
### House
Auction House is the trading feature in Aspect, where users can ask and bid against intelligent bots to influence market movement. This directory contains the House class and associated methods to facilitate the Auction House.
### Price
The core of the Aspect trading game. The price simulation program uses stochastic differential equations. historical_price directory holds all historical data referenced in a particular season. param_init initiates the parameters used in the program. alg_price includes the price simulation algorithm. price_init initiates the prices for all virtual companies.
### User
Contains all the helper functions to facilitate user actions in the frontend.

# Auction House
Contrary to stock simulations currently available in the market, in the Aspect stock market, users have influences on the stock prices. Through putting buy or sell orders in the auction house, users' demands and supplies affect the equilibrium prices. Besides users, there are trading bots present in the stock market constantly buying and selling. Each instance of the trading bot has a unique trading strategy that either mocks a type of investor or implements a statistical learning model.

## Bot Type One
Bot Type One consists of bots that adhere to game-theoretical, decision-making, or technical trading strategies. Most strategies in Bot Type One are simple and straightforward, aiming to represent typical groups of investors in the market.

## Bot Type Two
Bot Type Two frequently buys and sells at the market equilibrium price generated by the Aspect Price Simulator.

## Bot Type Three
Bot Type Three are AI bots with more advanced strategy models, primarily statistical regression or machine learning models. These strategies are more complex than Bot Type One and are commonly employed in high-frequency trading (HFT) and algorithmic trading. These bots aim to experiment with the performance of more complex statistical models in a stock market characterized by exceptional events, such as an economic crisis or a stock boom. In the first season, these bots overall performed better than Bot Type One.
